# Used iPhone Market Analysis

This is a Python data scraping and analysis project with Selenium & Pandas.

The main aim of this project is to analyse used iPhone listings in Lithuania based on features such as model, price, city, condition, description, etc and suggest improvements that could be implemented by the platform.

The data was scraped from [Skelbiu.lt](https://skelbiu.lt/), the most popular Lithuanian advertisement platform.

AI was used for statistical test code debugging purposes and KPI suggestions.
